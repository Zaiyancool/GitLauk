*Track:* Campus Management

*Problem:* Current safety infrastructure often lacks comprehensive coverage, real-time responsiveness, and accessibility features that address the diverse needs of the campus community, leaving gaps in protection and support.

*Solution:* Our app prioritizes minimalism for maximum safety. The interface is intentionally stripped down to only essential features, ensuring ease of use even under pressure. The SOS button is designed as a large, high visibility red button that covers nearly half of the screen, enabling onetap emergency activation without searching through menus. A clean realtime map provides instant situational awareness across campus. Emergency reports are visualized as red dots on the map, allowing users or staff to immediately identify where incidents occur. Details of each report can be accessed either by tapping on the red dot or through the dedicated report page. Users may also submit reports and add comments to existing ones for better clarity and faster response. This minimalist design approach eliminates distractions, enhances reaction speed, and ensures that all essential safety functions remain always accessible, especially when every second counts.


*Note:* The app is configured with USM,Pulau Pinang as the default map viewport since the system is intended primarily for on-campus usage. When the application launches, the map automatically centers on the USM coordinates to ensure accurate interaction with location-based features such as the SOS alert and issue reporting modules. However, if the app is tested outside the USM area, the user’s current position may initially fall outside the visible viewport. In this case, testers can manually zoom out or reposition the map to visualize their location, as real-time geolocation retrieval still functions correctly regardless of the current map focus.
